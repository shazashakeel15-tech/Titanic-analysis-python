Data analysis project using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
🐍 Titanic Survival Data Analysis (Python)
📊 Project Overview
This project analyzes the famous Titanic dataset to uncover insights about passenger survival patterns using Python.
It involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization to understand how factors like gender, age, class, and fare influenced survival rates.

🎯 Objectives

Analyze the relationship between passenger features and survival outcome.
Perform data cleaning and handle missing values.
Use visualizations to identify key insights.
Demonstrate data analysis skills using Python tools.

🧰 Tools & Libraries Used

Tool	Purpose
Python	Programming language
Pandas	Data manipulation and cleaning
NumPy	Numerical operations
Matplotlib	Static data visualization
Seaborn	Advanced data visualization
Google Colab 

🧼 Data Cleaning Steps

Loaded dataset using Pandas.
Checked for missing values and filled or dropped as needed.
Converted categorical variables (e.g., Sex, Embarked) into readable formats.
Removed unnecessary columns like Cabin due to excessive missing data.

🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Performed analysis to answer key questions such as:
What percentage of passengers survived?
Did gender affect survival?
Did passenger class (Pclass) have an impact?
How did age and fare influence survival rates?

📈 Key Insights

🚺 Female passengers had a much higher survival rate than males.
🏰 First-class passengers had the highest survival rate, while third-class had the lowest.
👶 Younger passengers had slightly better chances of survival.
💰 Higher fare values were associated with increased survival odds.
🚢 Most passengers boarded from Southampton port.
